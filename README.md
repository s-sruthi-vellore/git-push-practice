# git-push-practice
This repository is created to practice pushing a local project to GitHub using Git commands.  
The purpose is to get comfortable with terminal-based Git operations and syncing with a remote repository.  
Here, I will experiment with adding files, making changes, and updating them on GitHub.  
This repository is for learning purposes only and does not contain any real project code.
